**This is what gets passed in as data in order to create a new exercise
I'm not sure about the difference between add and complete yet...
...also need to figure out if I have to do the drop down bars on the html page 
- and if not, hwo they were set up cause I wanna know that
NOTE that date is not passed in... except in seeds.
...perhaps created at is date...

Are exersises part of a workout?
looks like API calls something an saves a "workout" in the frontend
